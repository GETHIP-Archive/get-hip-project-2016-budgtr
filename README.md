A GET-HIP 2015-2016 session project

# Database Migrations
Note, Ebean will create scripts that destroy the existing database and create a new one. They need to be run manually for the application to work. Also, production sql scripts will need to be made and run by hand.

The word user is reserved in PostgreSQL, so any scripts with the word user must have that work in quotation marks.
